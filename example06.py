Example for testing permanently or temporarily connected receivers

Usage:
    python example05.py             # running signal testing for no disconnect signal
                                    # and you can see two signal callback called
    python exapmle05.py disconnect  # running signal testing with disconnect one callback
                                    # and you can see only one signal callback called

Notice:
    **disconnect** can disconnect receiver from signalâ€™s events.
